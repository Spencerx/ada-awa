   --  The Do_Filter method of the Filter is called by the container each time
   --  a request/response pair is passed through the chain due to a client request
   --  for a resource at the end of the chain.  The Filter_Chain passed in to this
   --  method allows the Filter to pass on the request and response to the next
   --  entity in the chain.
   --
   --  Before passing the control to the next filter, initialize the service
   --  context to give access to the current application, current user and
   --  manage possible transaction rollbacks.
