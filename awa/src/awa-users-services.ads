--  == Introduction ==
--  The *users* module provides a *users* service which controls the user data model.
--
--  == Events ==
--  The *users* module exposes a number of events which are posted when some action
--  are performed at the service level.
--
--  === user-register ===
--  This event is posted when a new user is registered in the application.
--  It can be used to send a registration email.
--
--  === user-create ===
--  This event is posted when a new user is created.  It can be used to trigger
--  the pre-initialization of the application for the new user.
--
--  === user-lost-password ===
--  This event is posted when a user asks for a password reset through an
--  anonymous form.  It is intended to be used to send the reset password email.
--
--  === user-reset-password ===
--  This event is posted when a user has successfully reset his password.
--  It can be used to send an email.
--
--  === user-key-validation ===
--  This event is posted when a user has created a account and successfully
--  validated an access key.  It can be used to finish the accept invitation
--  process.
