--  == Initialization ==
--  The AWA application is represented by the `Application` type which should
--  be extended for the final application to provide the modules and specific
--  components of the final application.
--
--  The initialization of an AWA application is made in several steps
--  represented by different procedures of the main `Application` type.
--  The whole initialization is handled by the `Initialize` procedure
--  which gets a first set of configuration properties and a factory
--  to build specific component.
--
--  The `Initialize` procedure will perform the following steps:
--
--  * It uses the factory to allocate the ASF lifecycle handler, the navigation
--    handler, the security manager, the OAuth manager, the exception
--    handlers.
--  * It calls the `Initialize_Components` procedure to let the
--    application register all the ASF components.  These components must
--    be registered before any configuration file is read.
--  * It calls the `Initialize_Config`
--  * It calls the `Initialize_Servlets` procedure to allow the application
--    to register all the servlet instances used by the application.
--  * It calls the `Initialize_Filters` procedure to allow the application
--    to register all the servlet filter instances.  The application servlets
--    and filters must be registered before reading the global configuration file.
--  * It loads the global application configuration by reading the `awa.xml`
--    file as well as some application specific files.  By reading this
--    configuration, some global configuration is established on the servlets,
--    filters, navigation rules.  The list of XML files loaded during this
--    step is controlled by the `app.config` configuration.
--  * It calls the `Initialize_Modules` procedure so that all the application
--    modules can be registered, configured and initialized.  Each module
--    brings its own component, servlet and filter.  They are configured
--    by their own XML configuration file.
--  * It loads the module application configuration by reading the XML
--    files described by the `app.config.plugins` configuration.  This last
--    step allows the application to setup and update the configuration
--    of all modules that have been registered.
--
--  == Configuration ==
--  The following global configuration parameter are defined:
--
--  @include-config awa.xml
