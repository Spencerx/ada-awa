--  == Setup Procedure Instantiation==
--  The setup process is managed by the *Configure* generic procedure.
--  The procedure must be instantiated with the application class type and
--  the application initialize procedure.
--
--     procedure Setup is
--        new AWA.Setup.Applications.Configure (MyApp.Application'Class,
--                                              MyApp.Application_Access,
--                                              MyApp.Initialize);
--
--  == Setup Operation ==
--  The *Setup* instantiated operation must then be called with the web container.
--  The web container is started first and the *Setup* procedure gets as parameter
--  the web container, the application instance to configure, the application name
--  and the application context path.
--
--    Setup (WS, App, "atlas", MyApp.CONTEXT_PATH)
--
--  The operation will install the setup application to handle the setup actions.
--  Through the setup actions, the installer will be able to:
--
--  * Configure the database (MySQL or SQLite),
--  * Configure the Google+ and Facebook OAuth authentication keys,
--  * Configure the application name,
--  * Configure the mail parameters to be able to send email.
--
--  After the setup and configure is finished, the file <tt>.initialized</tt>
--  is created in the application directory to indicate the application is
--  configured.  The next time the *Setup* operation is called, the installation
--  process will be skipped.
--
--  To run again the installation, remove manually the <tt>.initialized</tt> file.
