--  = Storages Module =
--  The `storages` module provides a set of storage services allowing
--  an application to store data files, documents, images in a persistent area.
--  The persistent store can be on a file system, in the database or provided
--  by a remote service such as Amazon Simple Storage Service.
--
--  @include awa-storages-modules.ads
--
--  == Creating a storage ==
--  A data in the storage is represented by a `Storage_Ref` instance.
--  The data itself can be physically stored in a file system (`FILE` mode),
--  in the database (`DATABASE` mode) or on a remote server (`URL` mode).
--  To put a file in the storage space, first create the storage object
--  instance:
--
--    Data : AWA.Storages.Models.Storage_Ref;
--
--  Then setup the storage mode that you want.  The storage service uses
--  this information to save the data in a file, in the database or in
--  a remote service (in the future).
--  To save a file in the store, we can use the `Save` operation of the
--  storage service.
--  It will read the file and put in in the corresponding persistent store
--  (the database in this example).
--
--    Service.Save (Into => Data, Path => Path_To_The_File,
--                  Storage => AWA.Storages.Models.DATABASE);
--
--  Upon successful completion, the storage instance `Data` will be allocated
--  a unique identifier that can be retrieved by `Get_Id` or `Get_Key`.
--
--  == Getting the data ==
--  Several operations are defined to retrieve the data.  Each of them has been
--  designed to optimize the retrieval and
--
--    * The data can be retrieved in a local file.
--      This mode is useful if an external program must be launched and be able
--      to read the file.  If the storage mode of the data is `FILE`, the path
--      of the file on the storage file system is used.  For other storage modes,
--      the file is saved in a temporary file.  In that case the `Store_Local`
--      database table is used to track such locally saved data.
--
--    * The data can be returned as a stream.
--      When the application has to read the data, opening a read stream
--      connection is the most efficient mechanism.
--
--  == Local file ==
--  To access the data by using a local file, we must define a local storage
--  reference:
--
--    Data : AWA.Storages.Models.Store_Local_Ref;
--
--  and use the `Load` operation with the storage identifier.  When loading
--  locally we also indicate whether the file will be read or written.  A file
--  that is in `READ` mode can be shared by several tasks or processes.
--  A file that is in `WRITE` mode will have a specific copy for the caller.
--  An optional expiration parameter indicate when the local file representation
--  can expire.
--
--    Service.Load (From => Id, Into => Data, Mode => READ, Expire => ONE_DAY);
--
--  Once the load operation succeeded, the data is stored on the file system and
--  the local path is obtained by using the `Get_Path` operation:
--
--    Path : constant String := Data.Get_Path;
